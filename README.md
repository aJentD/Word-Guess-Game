# Word-Guess-Game

This is a Chuck Palahniuk themed word guess game.
Guess the title of the book to win; you have 10 guessed.

//Problems

1- The "Win" message displays as soon as user hits last correct letter; so user never sees completed words.
2- Did have time to figure out how to include audio.
3-Minor design flaws
